Format and process

- The `Unreleased` section contains completed tasks that have been removed from `TODO.md` and are targeted for the next release.
- Each entry should include: task id, summary, author, PR or commit link, and a one-line description of the change.
- When creating a release, move the entries from `Unreleased` to a new versioned section (e.g. `## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-20`) and include release notes.
